# Cracking the Coding Interview
Algorithm Practice from 6th Edition of Gayle Laakmann McDowell's "Cracking the Coding Interview"

## Purpose
I am working through some of the problems/concepts in "Cracking the Coding Interview."

I began working in Ruby, but the primary language I will be coding in is JavaScript.

This is by no means all of my algorithm work. There are so many awesome websites for algorithm challenges, and I don't want to limit myself.
